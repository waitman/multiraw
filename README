Processing Camera Raw files to JPEG, TIFF, or PPM formats is extremely time intensive. Utilizing multiple threads on multi-core systems can realize an increase of productivity and time savings of 60% ... ie, (769-257)/769 = .667
 
In these examples we are using dcraw-m, a modified version of dcraw which automatically rotates exported thumbnails and has a camera timezone offset adjustment variable. See the graphics/dcraw-m port to install.

The multiraw.c program allows the user to batch convert Camera Raw format files in parallel using pthreads. The user may specify the number of threads to run, or they may use the Auto Thread switch which will cause the software to determine the appropriate number of threads based on the task requested. By default, multiraw.c calls dcraw-m, which is included. If the user wishes to use the unmodified dcraw program, it may be specified using the -o switch.
